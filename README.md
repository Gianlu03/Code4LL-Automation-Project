# Code4LL-Automation-Project
Group automation project realised in order participate in a scolarship offered by Xion Technology to the students of fifth year of secondary school in
"I.S.S Piero Gobetti", IT course in 2021-2022. 

The activity consisted of simulating the foundation of a little IT company in groups of 5 people, each group had to develop a project from zero and to document the entire process.

My group's goal was to develop a machine based on a Raspberry Pi 4, which could gather information about the required movements issued by a human operator and carry them out.
Actions are provided through a 3D application developed in Unity (C#), which sends information to an SQL Server database. The Raspberry Pi collects the data from the database(Python)
